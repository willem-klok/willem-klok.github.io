The book 'Mindset' by Carol S. Dweck is subtitled 'changing the way you think to fulfil your potential.' It provides an overview of the fixed- and growth mindsets, and gives some practical tips on how to exchange the former for the latter.

This book is largely a comparison between how people with a fixed mindset act as opposed to how people with a growth mindset would have acted. Because of this, I present the summary as a comprehensive list of these comparisons, not following the chapter structure of the book.
### The fixed mindset
believing that your qualities are carved in stone. You are constantly trying to prove yourself, of your given amount of intelligence, personality and moral character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser? Risk and effort are two things that might reveal your inadequacies and show that you were not up to the task.
### The growth mindset
your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others. People can change and grow through application and experience. The belief that cherished qualities can be developed creates a passion for learning. It is different from open-mindedness, the goal is not to be flexible or open-minded but to be dedicated to grow.

There are four basic steps described in the book that can help you develop a growth mindset:
1. The first step to acquiring a growth-mindset is to acknowledge and accept that you have a, predominantly, fixed mindset at the moment. Being able to view things as they are is the only way to change them.
2. Become aware of your fixed-mindset triggers. When does your fixed-mindset persona come to surface?
3. Give your fixed-mindset persona a name.
4. Know that your persona will show up when you’re confronted with one of your triggers. Observe it when it does so, and thank it for its contribution. Talk to it how you can learn from a setback or how a step out of your comfort zone could help you become better. Your fixed-mindset persona was born to protect you and keep you safe. But it has developed some very limiting ways of doing that. Understand the persona’s point of view, but slowly teach it a different way of thinking, and take it with you on your journey to a growth mindset.

At the beginning of each day, remind yourself of the fixed and growth-mindset. Then, contemplate the day ahead of you, and ask yourself the following questions:
1. What are the opportunities for learning and growth today?
2. When, where, and how will I embark on these opportunities?

### Fixed mindset triggers
Below follows an overview that summarises the contents of the book. For a particular situation, it shows the fixed and growth mindset belief and response. Personally, I think that this way of summarising the book is most useful. By observing your actions (e.g. through journalling), you can become aware of your fixed mindset beliefs (number 2 on the 'grow a growth mindset'-action list), and than work to change them.
