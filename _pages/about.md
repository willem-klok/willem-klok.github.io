Welcome ot my personal page! This is where collect my 'creations' and other things that I think someone else would find worthwhile having access to. I use Github to host this page and took the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) as a starting point. I'm still learning how to make everything work and look nice, so you might find some oddities throughout (very sorry).
